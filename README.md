Submission for Challenge 10 - SQLAlchemy

## Precipitation Analysis
Analysis is included in the jupyter notebooked titled 'climate_stater.ipynb' under the header 'Exploratory Precipitation Analysis' in the notebook.
Note that the query that collects the date and precipitation for the last year of data passes the most recent date as a variable, using the method datetime.strptime to pass the 'year', 'month' and 'day' to the date interval formula ('year_back' variable in the code).
